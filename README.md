# small-projects
A repo filled with some practise projects 

This is a collection of small projects that i've worked on whilst learning web development.
It consists mainly of HTML and CSS using responsive design.

I've also utilised the css grid layout as well as bootstrap 4 framework.


Included within zenva-projects are some other small projects that i've put together whilst working through a web development mini-degree on zenva.com.  They include more responsive web pages.
